# SGNS-Implementation
Implementation of an SGNS (Skip gram negative sampling) algorithm for training tokenized vector embeddings.

Primary aim of this implementation is to investigate model vector outputs and how they work against test points.

Also to exemplify Word embedding training section of open source nlp readings.
